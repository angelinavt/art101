			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p> Hi there! We are Angelina and Santiago. I am Angelina writing here, I am sophomore art major
				and don't really have much coding experience. I am super into animation and love graphic design. 
				Santiago is a third year Literature major who has a cat whom he loves dearly! We both think 
				the class will be interesting and challening. 
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge to this lab is learning to figure out how to code with 
						HTML and CSS .</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest problem I encountered as did Santiago was working with the CSS code. It took a long time for things to update</thead> </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this was defintely a challening assignment, but we learned a lot from it and especially patience. Coding is no easy feat, but it is reawarding in the end.</p>
