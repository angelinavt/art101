					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The point of this lab was to understand how to add an unordered list, as well as include links to our lab pages on the homepage. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> One of the main difficulties we encountered was figuring out how to change the size of the text for the lab links section. There was also a point where periods were not aligned with our links, but rather were on top of each other. This was because we were missing the ul tag that wraps the li elements - leading to unexpected rendering. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was not easy, however it was challenging in a way that pushed us in the right direction with acquiring more coding experience. We put in quite a bit of energy and time into this assignment which paid off with our end result homepages being beautifully designed. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> In the end, we redecorated our homepages and added links to our past and future labs. We are becoming more comfortable with HTML and CSS and got to explore new coding formulas that we had not gotten the chance to explore yet, like adding an unordered list and including links.
