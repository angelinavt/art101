			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were asked to create a loop that would reveal which numbers are divisible by 7, 5, and 3 from numbers 1 to 200.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were confused about how to make our numbers reveal if they are divisible by multiple of our options or just one. When I used our example code from class, I realized we didnâ€™t cover it. </p>
