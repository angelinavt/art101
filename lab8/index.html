			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge with Lab 8 was to create anon and callback functions as well as an array of variables that could be called back and arranged to display in a console on our final web page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We faced a few challenges while doing this lab, and we needed to take a break at one point because we felt stuck. Once we met back up later, we figured out our mistakes and finished the lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>In the end, we were able to do all the tasks in the lab and feel good about the final result. Despite a few hiccups throughout the process of getting this lab done, we learned a lot more about the general coding scope of functions in greater detail with all this practice.</p>
