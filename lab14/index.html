					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to review all our past labs and identify any potential issues, then address and resolve them. We were lucky enough only to have one bug-filled lab.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem with this lab was figuring out what was causing the bug, but after using some of the debugging tools we learned in class, we were able to find out why our code wasnâ€™t connecting. </p>

For this lab, we had to debug lab 9 and lab 10. The issue with lab 9 was my button not working - so I went in and tweaked with the class code aspects on JS. For lab 10, the issue was that the text was not reprinting which had to do with function issues coming about.
