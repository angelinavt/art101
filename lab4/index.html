			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to understand how one could list a pseudocode on javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems we encountered were regarding the instructions on how to perform the pseudocodes and list them. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was really challening because of how time consuming it was, as well as difficult to understand in the process. Despite all of that, it was fun and a step in the right direction to learning how to code more efficiently. </p>
